Using Bootstrap to have the player input their guesses and have the other player input the word from the start, 
you have your hangman which is a very sophisticated game.
This game allows you have the first player to input the word that you want the other player to guess.  Then, the player would have to guess 6 letters correctly 
in order to continue to the game successfully.
